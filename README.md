- 👋 Hi, I’m @word45678
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Development, but also learning more techniques in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on Python, Java, and C++.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet, still brushing off rust and expanding my repetoire.
- 📫 How to reach me: carrier pigeons usually work best, otherwise I'm sure you'll find me somehow.
